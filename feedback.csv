2025-12-04T06:57:41.029111,Jalebi-Fafda,2,5,Absolutely delicious! The jalebis came out perfectly crispy and soaked the syrup beautifully. The fafda was light and crunchy—just like the traditional street-side taste. Loved it!

2025-12-04T06:59:03.201049,Jalebi-Fafda,2,4,The dish turned out really good! Jalebi had the perfect texture and the fafda had that classic flavor. My family enjoyed it a lot. Will definitely make this again!

2025-12-04T09:44:53.284286,Jalebi-Fafda,8,1,"Jalebi was sweet but lacked freshness, and the fafda was slightly oily. Not bad, but definitely not what I was hoping for"
